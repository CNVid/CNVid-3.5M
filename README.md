This repository contains the dataset, codebase, and benchmarks for our paper : <CNVid-3.5M: Build, Filter, and Pre-train the Large-scale Public Chinese Video-text Dataset>, which has been accepted by CVPR 2023.

## Dataset

Check [DATASET.md](DATASET.md) for instructions of dataset downloading and preprocessing (CNVid-3.5M).

## Codebase

Check [CODEBASE.md](CODEBASE.md) for instructions of codebase downloading and model pre-training (CNVid-3.5M).
We have already prepared the codebase, but we still need some time to obtain the external disclosure authorization by our group. The codebase is planned to be published in Augest, 2023.

## Benchmark

Check [BENCHMARK.md](BENCHMARK.md) for instructions of benchmark downloading and model fine-tuning (CNVid-3.5M).
We have already prepared the benchmark, but we still need some time to obtain the external disclosure authorization by our group. All benchmarks are planned to be published in Augest, 2023.
